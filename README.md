This repository demonstrates that I have completed a survey of the primitive data types and have understood and used their basic functions.

I have also learned that:
- The built-in data type functions are vast enough to help perform most of the operations we ever will need to do
- All languages have similar capabilities when it comes to what you can do with information
- Certain actions are easier with Python over JavaScript, and vice versa, but both languages are still capable of solving the same kinds of problems
