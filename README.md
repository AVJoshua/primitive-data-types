This repository demonstrates that I have completed a survey of the primitive data types and have understood and used their basic functions.

I have also learned that:
- Strings and Numbers exist as Objects that have properties, attributes, and methods which are vast enough to help perform most of the operations we ever will need to do
- There are also built-in functions in both javascript and python that provide additional capabilities
- In general, all languages have similar capabilities when it comes to what you can do with information and differ only in the "how"
- Certain objectives are better reached using Python over JavaScript, and vice versa, but both languages are still capable of solving the same kinds of problems
