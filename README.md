This repository demonstrates that I have completed a survey of the primitive data types and have understood and used their basic functions.

I have also learned that:
- Strings and Numbers exist as Objects that have properties, attributes, and methods
- These are vast enough to help perform most of the operations we ever will need to do
- There are also built-in functions in both javascript and python that provide additional capabilities
- Certain objectives are better reached using Python over JavaScript, and vice versa
- In general, all languages have similar capabilities and differ only in the implementation

How to run tests:
- Simply fork and clone the repo and run `./run-all.sh` from the root directory
- May need to `chmod +x run-all.sh` to update permissions
- You can also run individual tests e.g. `node strings/strings.js` for the javascript strings exercises
