This folder is to demonstrate that I have completed a survey of the primitive data types using their basic functions

We also learn that often in built functions are vast enough to help perform most of the operations we ever will do

We also learn a fundamental concept in programming, which is that all languages have similar capabilities when it comes to what you can do with information

Also started to learn the differences and similarities between python and javascript as interpreted and compiled languages

Also learn what is better with python vs javascript, but this will become more clear as we do further advanced things
